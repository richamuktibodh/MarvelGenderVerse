[As the opening credits fly past in a montage, Bruce Banner is sitting on a chair in a white hazard room of sorts, gamma radiation being aimed at his head with a green reticle on a hanging contraption rotating around him. Betty Ross pushes on some buttons and pulls levers behind a window separating her and Banner's room while the reticle turns. She then observes the machine's action Danger lights begin to flash, and Banner suddenly transforms into a muscular green monster, the only shred of humanity left on him being his shredded pants. The window is broken and the hazard room is destroyed]
[Cut to a first person view of Banner seeing Betty Rose on the floor covered in scrapes, unconscious. Gunshots can be heard ringing out as Banner then turns around to see a military officer aiming at him with a pistol. Lieutenant General Thaddeus Ross is next to the officer, dumbstruck. Banner pulls Thaddeus out of frame, and then punches the military officer through a door. Thaddeus is left bloody and weak, pleading Banner to stop]
[Cut to Betty in a hospital bed, asleep. Banner enters the room and is devastated. Thaddeus enters afterward with his left arm in a cast, lays a hand on Banner's shoulder, and, presumably threatens Banner to stay away from his daughter.

[Cut to a sprawling shot of Rocinha Favela, Brazil]
[Cut to the inside of Banner's apartment, where Banner is cooking food atop a stove, his dog on his left]

[Cut to Banner and an aikido instructor throwing each other around in a large window-lit building. The two then sit on the floor facing each other]
Aikido Instructor: [In Portuguese] Let's work on your breathing. Here, emotion. [In English] Fear no good. So emotion and control.
[The instructor points at his heart and his stomach respectively when saying the last line of dialogue. The two then begin breathing rapidly]
Aikido Instructor: [In Portuguese] Use your diaphragm. The best way to control your anger is to control your body. Control your pulse. [In English] Breathe, Breathe,
[The instructor slaps Banner across the face, causing Banner's wrist watch to start beeping with the rise in Banner's heart rate. Banner starts to rapidly breathe again]
Aikido Instructor: [In Portuguese] Breathe.
[The instructor slaps Banner again, causing Banner's wrist watch to start beeping faster than before]
Bruce Banner: Wait.
[Banner checks his watch to see his heartbeat at 146 BPM. The BPM stays steady as the beeping slows down]
[Cut to another shot of Rocinha Favela, Brazil]
[Cut to a bustling street in the aforementioned town]
[Cut to the busy locker room of the Pingo Doce Bottling Plant. Banner is at his locker when a group of tough workers' leader purposefully walks into him. Banner ignores the action. and the workers continue onward through the locker room]
[Cut to the production line of the plant, where alarms are buzzing with the start of the conveyor belts. Workers begin to enter the large room. Banner pushes a cart full of boxed supplies amongst the business. He takes one off and hands it to Martina. Banner continues onward and is then requested by the plant manager from a walkway above Banner]
[Cut to a faulty remote sparking, which Banner then analyzes, taking out glasses to do so. All the while, the manager is by his side. Banner fiddles with some wires]
Bruce Banner: Okay.
[Banner presses the button on the remote, and the line next to him starts moving]
Bruce Banner: I can make it work for a while, but you need, uh - [Banner then attempts to converse in Portuguese]
Plant Manager: [In Portuguese and a comedic tone] I need a new factory.
Bruce Banner: Okay. Okay.
Plant Manager: [In Portuguese] Five months you've been helping me out like this. You're too smart for day labor. Let me put you on payroll.
{Banner accidently cuts himself on some wiring, causing a drop of his blood to fall onto a production line below them]
Bruce Banner: No, no, no! Shut that off! Turn it off!
[Banner runs about the walkway]
Bruce Banner: Watch out!
[Banner and the manager shout a Portuguese phrase at a worker near a button. He presses it and an alarm is buzzed as the production line comes to a halt. Banner quickly manages to find his blood merely on the conveyor belt. He takes a handkerchief and wipes up the splotch. Banner then takes an anti=biotic cream container out of his shirt pocket and applies it to his cut finger]
Bruce Banner: Okay!
[The manager commands in Portuguese to restart the production line. As Banner walks away, the camera pans back to reveal that some blood was dripping down the interior bottle neck of a bottle. The bottle is filled with soda, and the blood mixes with the drink. A montage of shots ensure of the bottle being prepared to be shipped]
[A alarm sounds throughout the plant to signal the working day's end. As Banner walks towards the exit, he notices Martina being harassed by the leader of the group of tough workers. Banner approaches the situation]
Bruce Banner: [In Portuguese] Martina! You want to have lunch with me?
Tough Guy Leader: [In Portuguese] Get lost, Gringo. You got a problem? Too late.
Bruce Banner: [In Portuguese] Don't make me … hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm ... hungry.
Tough Guy #1: Hmm?
Bruce Banner: That's not right.
[The Tough Guy Leader then lunges at Banner, missing. Before he can strike again, the plant manager calls down at the two, stopping the fight. Martina and Banner then leave]
[Cut to another establishing shot of Rocinha Favela, Brazil]
[Cut to Banner walking the streets again where he meets up with Alves, who hands Banner an item wrapped in green paper]
Bruce Banner: Oh, you.
[Banner hugs Alves, then runs back to his apartment]
Bruce Banner: [To his dog as he enters his apartment] You see that? See that? My ticket out of here.
[Banner pulls out a folded satellite dish from a bookbag of his. He then connects it to his laptop, and boots up an encrypted messaging program]
Bruce Banner: [Through text] Blue, are you there?
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Mr. Green! Good hearing from you again, my mysterious friend!
Bruce Banner: [Through text] I've found it.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] At long last. It's a lively little flower, isn't it? Be sure to try a high does. Good luck :)
[Banner begins snipping petals off the flower that was wrapped in the green paper. He grabs some vials and begins mixing their contents with the petals] After multiple chemical procedures, Banner is rewarded with a vial full of a purple liquid. He pricks himself to draw his blood onto a petri dish. Banner pours some of the purple liquid onto his blood, then looks through a microscope to see the gamma radiation in his blood is briefly subsided by the remedy. But, the remedy is not enough, as his blood cells erupt into a radiated mess quickly afterward. Banner sighs]
Bruce Banner: Damn it! [Through text] Another failure.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] :( How much did you use?
Bruce Banner: [Through text] All of it.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Then it's time to meet.
Bruce Banner: [Through text] Not safe.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Living with GAMMA poisoning not safe. Stop chasing flowers. Send me a blood sample. Can't help if you won't let me.
[Banner extracts a large vial of blood from his inner elbow, puts it in a shoebox, and puts Mr. Blue's address on a note on top of it]
[Cut to Banner sending the package out at the post office. He walks outside and stands in the middle of the street, hands on hips and sighing]
[Cut to an establishing shot of Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon is in center frame]
[Cut to Thaddeus Ross's office, where Major Kathleen Sparr hands him a report]
Kathleen Sparr: Here's something a bit more interesting. It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee. A man drank one of those guarana sodas. Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.
[Cut to a man opening his fridge, reaching for a soda, opening it and drinking]
Milwaukee Man: Wow.
[He starts choking and falls unconscious, dropping the soda onto the floor, shattering it]
[Cut back to Ross's office, where Ross arises from his chair]
Thaddeus Ross: Where was it bottled?
Kathleen Sparr: Porto Verde, Brazil.
Thaddeus Ross: Get our agency people looking for a white man at that bottling plant. Tell them no contact! If he even sees them, he's gone.
[Cut to Fort Johnson, Everglades, where a camo-painted humvee and a military buggy drives past the camera towards the airfield, where helicopters overhead can be seen. Thaddeus Ross and General Joe Greller are standing next to one another, with Greller having a file in hand]
Joe Greller: I got you who I could. Short notice, but they're all quality. And I pulled you one ace. Emil Blonsky. Born in Russia, raised in England. And on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines.
[Blonsky arrives via helicopter, carrying a duffel bag in his right hand]
Thaddeus Ross: I know you cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Joe Greller: Glad I could help. Just make it good.
[Cut to a large military airbus leaving the base with a thunderstorm approaching behind them]
[Cut to the interior of the airbus]
Kathleen Sparr: This is the target and the location. Snatch and grab, live capture. You'll have your dart clips and suppression ordnance, but live fire is for backup only. We got local out there, but we want it tight and quiet.
Emil Blonsky: Is he a fighter?
Thaddeus Ross: Your target is a fugitive from the US government who stole military secrets. He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists, a military officer, an Idaho state trooper, and possibly two Canadian hunters. So don't wait to see if he's a fighter! Tranq him and bring him back.
[Cut to Banner's apartment, where Banner is laying on his bed with a desk fan blowing towards him. Suddenly, his laptop beeps]
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Good news. Preliminary blood tests show significant gamma reduction.
Bruce Banner: [Through text] Will it cure me?
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Yes. But … I need more DATA.
Bruce Banner: Oh, come on.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Exposure levels. Gamma concentration. Cell saturation.
Bruce Banner: [Through text] Impossible. Data is not here.
Mr. Blue: [Through text] Where is it?
Bruce Banner: [Through text] HOME.
[Banner closes the laptop, and another establishing shot of Rocinha Favela, Brazil is shown]
[Cut to Ross's soldier's positioning themselves around the town]
Thaddeus Ross: Camera.
[A soldier with a tracker pushes a wire with a camera in its tip underneath Banner's door]
Thaddeus Ross: Here we go.
[Ricky, Banner's dog, notices the camera and bites it]
Thaddeus Ross: Get rid of the damn dog.
[The soldiers retrieve the camera, and begin putting charges around Banner's door]
Thaddeus Ross: Take him.
[The charges blow and the soldiers, led by Blonsky, enter the room. They shoot tranquillizer darts at Banner's bed, only to find it was only a pillow and another blanket underneath Banner's sheets]
Emil Blonsky: Target's on the move.
[Blonsky shoots a dart at Ricky to stop his barking]
Thaddeus Ross: Where is he?
Emil Blonsky: He's on the ground.
Commando: Let's go! Go! Move, move!
[Banner, who was hiding in Martina's apartment, kisses her on the cheek]
Bruce Banner: [In Portuguese] Thank you.
[Banner races through the street in a sweatshirt with the hood up. As he approaches the military party, he begins walking to avoid suspicion. Blonsky notice him]
Emil Blonsky: Go, go, go!
Thaddeus Ross: Go! Go!
Commando: Clear everyone out!
Thaddeus Ross: Do not lose him!
[Banner is continued to be chased through the streets and alleyways of Brazil]
Commando: Oh! No! [Falls from a balcony into an alleyway]
[Banner is still continued to be chased through the streets and alleyways of Brazil, now with his watch beeping. Banner hides quickly to lower his heartrate and then continues running]
Thaddeus Ross: Get around behind him!
Kathleen Sparr: Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.
[As Banner continues the chase, he runs into the Tough Guy Leader in the streets]
Bruce Banner: Oh, no. You got to be kidding me.
[Banner dodges a punch to the face from the leader and throws him over his shoulder. He grabs the knee of one of the leader's goons and pulls it. Another tries to punch Banner, but he manages to avoid it as well. Banner then continues to run, with the tough guys muttering in Portuguese to one another. They then give chase as well. Banner eventually makes it into the Pingo Doce plant]
Thaddeus Ross: Where is he?
Emil Blonsky: Target acquired.
[Banner runs into the now empty locker room, his watch beeping rapidly. He again takes deep breathes to slow it down]
Tough Guy Leader: [faintly] Gringo!
[Banner continues running through the plant as the tough guys taunt Banner in Portuguese. Meanwhile, the soldiers make their advance]
Commando: Let's go.
[Banner is then cornered by the tough guys, one of them wrapping his arms around Banner's waist]
Bruce Banner: Please! No! Not the computer! Gimme that! No!
[The tough guys pin Banner up against the elevator cage]
Tough Guy Leader: [In Portuguese] Not so tough now, huh? Try those fancy moves again. Come on.
Bruce Banner: [In Portuguese] Stop. Please. Me … angry … very bad.
Tough Guy Leader: You bad angry, G? I very bad angry.
[Banner notices the commandos taking positions around the plant]
Bruce Banner: Oh, no. You don't understand! Something really bad is about to happen here!
Tough Guy Leader: [In Portuguese] Yeah, very bad.
[A silenced dart is shot and hits one of the tough guys. Before any of them could react, the leader punches Banner in the stomach, Banner's watch beeping the most it has ever had. As Banner falls to the floor and the leader laughs, Banner's BPM hits 200, causing him to transform into the creature from the opening credits: The Hulk]
Commando: Anyone else seeing this?
[Hulk throws the leader across the room, killing him from the impact of hitting the wall. The other tough guys run from the monster]
Commando: We've got a bogey of some kind. Please advise.
Thaddeus Ross: That is the target! Use every tranq you've got! Do it now!
[The commandos open fire on Hulk, only for their darts to bounce off him. Hulk then charges them]
Commando #1: Go live! Go live! Go live!
Commando #2: Get out of the way!
Commando #1: Move!
[Hulk manages to take down a commando]
Thaddeus Ross: No!
[The commandos open fire with actual rounds on Hulk, causing him to throw one into the conveyor belt controls. As the alarms blare, the commandos continue to spread out]
Commando: It's behind us! Move! Move! Get him! Shoot! Shoot!
[Blonsky throws a grenade at Hulk, temporarily stopping him]
Hulk: Leave me alone.
[Hulk pushes a cylinder-shaped container at the commandos, crushing three of them. Blonsky continues his pursuit on an upper walkway. Hulk then throws a forklift at Blonsky, causing a machine below them to explode, breaking the walkway in front of Blonsky. Hulk then throws another plant component at a wall, and escapes the facility]
Thaddeus Ross: No! No!
[Cut to Banner's apartment, where Thaddeus, Blonsky, and Sparr have all regrouped]
Emil Blonsky: I knew something was different before I got the shot off. He had it on him when he bolted.
[Blonsky hands a newspaper image of Betty Rose to Thaddeus]
Emil Blonsky: Is that a girlfriend? She helps him maybe?
Thaddeus Ross: She is no longer a factor. We closed that door to him a long time ago. He's alone. He wants to be alone. But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Emil Blonsky: Forgive me, sir? Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? 'Cause … he didn't lose us. And he was not alone, sir. We had him, and then something hit us. Something … BIG hit us! It threw a forklift truck like it was a SOFTBALL! It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.
Thaddeus Ross: Well, it's gone.
Emil Blonsky: Well, if Banner knows what it is, I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat, and I'm gonna—
Thaddeus Ross: That was Banner. It was Banner.
Emil Blonsky: [understandably confused] You'll have to explain that, sir.
Ross: No, I don't. You've done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.
[Cut to a vibrant Guatemala forest, where Banner is wandering aimlessly in only his ripped pants. A Guatemalan man in a small truck comes up along a dirt path causing Banner to wave his arms to have him stop]
Bruce Banner: Wait. Please. [In Portuguese] Can you help me?
Guatemalan Trucker: [In Spanish] I don't speak Portuguese.
Bruce Banner: Wha - Where am I? [In Spanish] Where am I?
Guatemalan Trucker: [In Spanish] Guatemala. I'm going to the next town.
Bruce Banner: [In Spanish] Will you help me?
Guatemalan Trucker: [In Spanish] Get in. Here, put this on.
[The trucker gives Banner a towel and continues down the path with Banner in the passenger seat]
Guatemalan Trucker: [In Spanish] Where are you going?
Bruce Banner: [In Spanish] Home.
[Cut to a hallway in the Pentagon, where Blonsky and Thaddeus are conversing]
Emil Blonsky: I've run into bad situations on crap missions before. I've seen good men do down purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into. I've moved on to the next one, because that's what we do, right? I mean, that's the job. But this? This is a whole new level of weird. And I don't feel incline to step away from it. So, if you're taking another crack at him, I want in. And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight, because if that thing shows up again, you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants. Sir.
[Cut to Chiapas, Mexico. Banner is walking the streets and is desperate for essentials and money. While sitting in a market with arms outstretched and his hands palmed togethers, a boy gives him some pesos. Banner then goes to a clothes venue.]
Bruce Banner: [In Spanish] Pants. You have them? Are they very stretchy?
[The merchant hands him a pair]
Bruce Banner: [In Spanish] Yeah, Perfect.
[Cut to Banner on his trek back to America]
[Cut to Thaddeus briefing Blonsky about Banner in the Pentagon]
Thaddeus Ross: Let me emphasize that what I'm about to share with you is tremendously sensitive, both to me personally and the Army. You know that we've got an Infantry Weapons Development Department program. Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Emil Blonsky: Yeah, super-soldier.
Thaddeus Ross: Yes, An oversimplification, but yes. And I dusted it off, got 'em doing serious work again, bold work. Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better. We were tryin' to make you better. Banner’s work was very early phase. It wasn’t even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance. I would never have told him what the project really was. But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself. And something went very wrong. Or it went very right. As far as I’m concerned, that man’s whole body is property of the US Army.
Emil Blonsky: You said he wasn’t working on weapons, right?
Thaddeus Ross: No.
Emil Blonsky: But you were. You were, weren’t you? You were trying other things.
Thaddeus Ross: One serum we developed … was very promising.
Emil Blonsky: So why did he run?
Thaddeus Ross: He’s a scientist. He is not one of us. Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
Emil Blonsky: 39.
Thaddeus Ross: It takes a toll, doesn't it?
Emil Blonsky: Yes, it does.
Thaddeus Ross: So get out the trenches. You should be a Colonel by now, with your record.
Emil Blonsky: No, I'm a fighter. I'll be one for as long as I can. You know, if I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had ten years ago, that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.
Thaddeus Ross: I could probably arrange something like that.
[Cut to an establishing shot of Culver University, Virginia. After realizing he would need credentials to actually enter the main building, Banner leaves the campus to go to Stanley's Pizza Parlor]
Stanley Lieber: [To a group leaving the restaurant] Take care, kids.
[Lieber attempts to close shop when Banner arrives at the door. Lieber eagerly lets him in. The two then sit at a table in the kitchen of the restaurant]
Bruce Banner: Stan, I give you my word, whatever you've heard about me, it's not true.
Stanley Lieber: Oh, I know it. I always knew it. I mean, you know how I felt about you two. Have you talked to her?
Bruce Banner: No. She doesn't know that I'm here. She's with somebody?
Stanley Lieber: Yeah, he's a head shrink. They saw he's one of the best. But a really nice guy.
Bruce Banner: Good. That's good.
Stanley Lieber: Bruce, what can I do to help you?
Bruce Banner: I could use a bed for a few nights.
Stanley Lieber: You can have the spare room upstairs.
Bruce Banner: That'd be so great. There is - Um, there is one other thing.
[Cut to Banner riding across Culver University campus on a bicycle, wearing Stanley's Pizza Parlor attire and having pizza boxes in the front basket of his bike]
Bruce Banner: Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.
[Cut to Banner walking towards the security desk]
Bruce Banner: Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.
Security Guard: I don't think there's anybody up there.
Bruce Banner: Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect. You got to let me try. I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium. Take it on the house.
[The security guard opens the box Banner hands him, and smirks at him, allowing Banner to proceed]
Bruce Banner: You are the man.
[The two shake hands]
Security Guard: God bless you, brother. [sits down] All right.
[Cut to Banner entering the same hazard room he was in five years prior. It has been fixed, and is now more similar to a computer lab. Bribing Roger Harrington with pizza to access one of the computers, he signs into one as Betty Ross. Unfortunately, any and all work associated with his gamma project had been erased from the college's records. Banner loads up the messaging program from Brazil]
Mr. Blue: [through text] Mr. Green! How goes the search?
Bruce Banner: [through text] The data is gone.
Mr. Blue: [through text] Without it … I cannot help. So what now?
Bruce Banner: [through text] I've got to keep moving.
[Cut to Banner's new apartment above the pizza parlor. Cut again to the interior of Stanley's Pizza Parlor]
Stanley Lieber: We're pretty well closed here, folks. I'm sorry.
Betty Ross: Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
[Betty Ross and Leonard Samson have entered the restaurant]
Stanley Lieber: Oh, kids. I got nothing but marinara now.
Betty Ross: Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
Leonard Samson: She worked through dinner again, of course.
Stanley Lieber: Ah.
[Cut to Banner walking around the kitchen]
Bruce Banner: Stan?
[Cut back to the dining area]
Leonard Samson: [To Betty and laughing] And he … I go, "So, yeah, I mean, where were you? I can't … I don't know where you were, Cecil." And he goes, "Not where you been at." I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful. Y'know, I felt like horrified.
[Suddenly. Betty notices Banner open the kitchen door, before he subsequently disappears. She investigates, interrupting Samson's story. As she exits the backdoor, the alleyway is completely empty. Thunder can be heard from an oncoming storm]
Betty Ross: Bruce?
[The camera zooms out to reveal Banner hiding behind a nearby dumpster]
Leonard Samson: Betty? What's going on?
[The couple reenter the restaurant]
Stanley Lieber: Betty-
Betty Ross: Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
Stanley Lieber: I don't know what to say.
Betty Ross: Please, just tell me the truth.
[Cut to Banner walking the streets, rain pouring around him and cars passing by him. Banner unsuccessfully signals to hitchhike at one. A car zooms toward Banner and stops right behind him. Betty exits the vehicle and the two stare at each other. ]
Betty Ross: Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just walk in and talk to my father.
Bruce Banner: He told me what he was gonna do. He wants it out of me. He wants to dissect it so he can replicate it. He wants to make it a weapon.
Betty: What is it like? When it happens, what do you experience?
Bruce: Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? Those induced hallucinations? It’s a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified. It’s like someone poured a liter of acid into my brain.
Betty: Do you remember anything?
Bruce: Just fragments. Images. There’s too much noise, I can never derive anything out of it.
Betty: But then, it’s still you, inside of it—
Bruce: No. No, it’s not.
Betty: I don’t know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there, it’s just overcharged and can’t process what’s happening-
Bruce: I don’t want to control it. I want to get rid of it.
[after Blonsky has every bone in his body shattered during a fight with the Hulk]
Major Kathleen "Kat" Sparr: Sir, Blonsky…
Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: [expecting the worst] Does anyone know if he had any next-of-kin or family?
Sparr: Ask him yourself.
Emil Blonsky: [in perfect health, salutes Ross] Sir!
General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: Betty…
Betty Ross: I will never forgive what you’ve done to him.
Gen. Ross: He’s a fugitive.
Betty: You made him a fugitive. To cover your failures, and to protect your career. Don’t ever speak to me as your daughter again.
Gen. Ross: It’s only because you’re my daughter that you’re not in handcuffs too!
[General Ross meets with Betty's boyfriend]
Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: You did the right thing contacting us. Leonard, I need to know where they're going. She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.
Leonard Samson: From who? He protected her, you almost killed her.
Ross: I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.
Leonard: You know, it's a point of professional pride for me that I can tell when somebody's lying. And you are. I don't know where he's going. I know she'll help him if she can.
Ross: Then she's aiding a fugitive. And I can't help either one of them. [walks off]
Leonard: I used to wonder why she never talked about you. Now I know.
Ross: [to himself] Where does she meet these guys?
Major Kathleen "Kat" Sparr: Are you telling me you can make more like him?
Dr. Samuel Sterns: No, not yet! I've sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident, the goal is to do it better!
Sparr: So Banner was the only—wait—[Knocked unconscious]
Emil Blonsky: Aah, she's an annoying bitch, isn't she?
Sterns: Why are you always hitting people?! [Blonsky pulls out his gun and points it at Dr. Sterns] Now what…could I have possibly done…to deserve such aggression?
Blonsky: [mumbling agitatedly] It's not what you've done, it's what you're gonna do. [Dr. Sterns raises his head, interested] I want what you've got off Banner, I want that.
Sterns: [rising] You look like…you've got a little something in you already, don't you?
Blonsky: Yeah, well, I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?
Sterns: I have…and it's beautiful. Godlike.
Blonsky: I want that…I need that. Make me that.
Sterns: I don't know what you've got inside you already. The mixture could become…an abomination. [Blonsky grabs Dr. Sterns by the collar and raises him into the air] I didn't say I was unwilling…I just need informed consent…and you've given it!
[in New York City]
Betty Ross: The subway is probably quickest.
Bruce Banner: Me? In a metal tube, deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?
Betty: …right, let's get a cab.
. . .
[one very stressful cab ride later]
Betty: [kicking the cab door as she gets out] Asshole!
Bruce: You know, I know a few techniques that could help you manage that anger effectively—
Betty: You zip it! We're walking.
Bruce: …okay.
Abomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General…any last words?
Hulk: [rouses] HULK…SMASH!! [smashes the ground]
[General Ross sulks at a bar]
General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: [Drinks shot] Reload. [barkeep gets another shot; Ross chugs the shot] Reload.
Shadowy Figure: [Approaches Ross] Mmmm, the smell of stale beer and defeat. Y'know, I hate to say "I told you so," General, but that Super-Soldier program was put on ice for a reason. [Appears as Tony Stark] I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.
Ross: Stark.
Stark: General.
Ross: You always wear such nice suits.
Stark: Touché. I hear you have an unusual problem.
Ross: You should talk.
Stark: You should listen. [the General leans in a bit as Stark whispers] What if I told you we were putting a team together?
Ross: Who's "we"?
[Stark clears his throat, looks at the General, and smiles.]
[Pre-credits scene: General Ross sulks at a bar]
Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: [Drinks shot] Reload. [Barkeep gets another shot; Ross chugs the shot] Reload.
Tony Stark: [Approaches Ross] Mmmm, the smell of stale beer and defeat. Y'know, I hate to say "I told you so," General, but that Super-Soldier program was put on ice for a reason. [Appears as Tony Stark] I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.
Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross: Stark.
Tony Stark: General.
